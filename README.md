# Fingerprint-Site
Hello there,

This is a basic Linux utility to get a website fingerprint using the whatweb tool (preloaded in Kali Linux).

The syntax you need to use to create a website fingerprint is as follows:
./fingerprint.sh -s <resource_URL>

This tool will perform the request with whatweb and export a neat text file with all the server information.

Feel free to use it and make any changes you need.

Best regards,
Angel
